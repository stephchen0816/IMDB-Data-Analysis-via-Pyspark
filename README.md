# IMDB-Data-Analysis-via-Pyspark

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to use Apache Spark, a data processing framework, that utilizes a large-scale data process with the use clusters. 
This project analyzes a subset of IMDB's actors, genres, movie actors, and movie ratings data from the Kaggle site (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashirwadsangwan/imdb-dataset). 
In order to analyze this large dataset, Spark Cluster on the Amazon EMR Ecosystem was used to load and analyze the data through the use of Jupyter Notebook. 
In this notebook, a public S3 bucket was also utilized in order to read the data. Multiple queries were then run using PySpark, the Python API for Apache Spark.
